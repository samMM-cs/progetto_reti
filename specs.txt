implement the following topology in mininet
Router connections:
  R1-R3:
    ip: 200.0.0.0/30
    bandwidth: 500M
    propagation delay: 10ms
  R3-R5:
    ip: 200.0.1.0/30
    bandwidth: 500M
    propagation delay: 10ms
  R5-R6:
    ip: 200.0.2.0/30
    bandwidth: 1G
    propagation delay: 10ms
  R3-R4:
    ip: 200.0.3.0/30
    bandwidth: 1G
    propagation delay: 10ms
  R4-R2:
    ip: 200.0.4.0/30
    bandwidth: 500M
    propagation delay: 10ms

Subnet behind R1: 
  addresses: 10.0.0.0/24
  hosts: H1 H2
  bandwidth: 100M
  propagation delay: 1ms

Subnet behind R3: 
  addresses: 10.1.0.0/24
  hosts: H3
  bandwidth: 100M
  propagation delay: 1ms

Subnet behind R5: 
  addresses: 10.2.0.0/24
  hosts: H4 H5
  bandwidth: 100M
  propagation delay: 0.05ms

Subnet behind R6: 
  addresses: 10.3.0.0/24
  hosts: H6
  bandwidth: 100M
  propagation delay: 1ms

Subnet behind R2: 
  addresses: 10.4.0.0/24
  hosts: PROXY S1 S2
  bandwidth: 100M
  propagation delay: 1ms

use a SDN controller (ryu-manager) to configure addresses and flow tables for each switch. configure the routers using REST

additionally:
  - all hosts should be able to reach eachothers, except for S1 and S2 which should only be reachable by PROXY. 
  - PROXY should implement a reverse proxy service with NGINX. every other access attempt to S1 and S2 must not be possible
  - S1 should implement a tcp server listening on port 5555
  - S2 should implement a udp server listening on port 5555
  - PROXY exposes both servers on port 8888, forwarding S1's traffic on the tcpserver/ path and s2's traffic on the udpserver/ path
  - both servers have to log in real time all applicative layer packets sent by all clients on the network. Data to be logged are the following:
    - timestamp
    - sender ip
    - sender port
    - receiver ip
    - receiver port
    - payload
    - payload length
  - H1, H2, H3 should implement a tcp client that sends packets to s1. The payload should be randomly generated with a variable length chosen at runtime. The sending interval should also be variable and assigned at runtime. If T=0, packets are sent at the maximum capacity
  - H4, H5, H6 should implement a udp client that sends packets to s2. The payload should be randomly generated with a variable length chosen at runtime. The sending interval should also be variable and assigned at runtime. If T=0, packets are sent at the maximum capacity
  - measure network performance in the following scenarios:
    - every tcp host sending at maximum data-rate
    - every udp host sending at maximum data-rate. Verify queueing problems and adjust T accordingly to get the maximum rate without congestion
    - every tcp host sending at the same time
  - store the logs in json format on the filesystem or database
  - graph the results
